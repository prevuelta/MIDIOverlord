This is a MIDI mapping & sequencing tool currently in development for OS X.

It is my first Obj C project so the code is not the greatest - but will hopefully be improved over time.

It uses (and is grateful for) the [MIKMIDI](https://github.com/mixedinkey-opensource/MIKMIDI) framework for alot of midi command processing & device detection / connection.

Also thanks to [Brad Frost](http://bradfrost.com/) for the inspiration to start an open design process.

### Modules

For a standard midi note on / note off command - a receive note can be mapped to multiple send notes eg. D1 to a chord (C, E, G)
